					<p>Blanco was our resident American alligator at the Houston Zoo. He suffered from a condition called leucism. Unlike albinism, leucism is caused by a partial or complete loss of <em>all</em> types of pigment, not just melanin. Think of it as having one huge white spot, with the occasional blotch of normal pigmentation, and blue eyes instead of the pale, pink eyes associated with albinism.</p>
			
					<p>This all sounds pretty neat until you consider the physiology of an alligator, or all reptiles for that matter.</p>

					<p>Reptiles need heat to help them digest their food. Due to being cold-blooded, they dont have the ability to thermoregulate their body temperature like warm-blooded animals. In order to raise their body temperature, most reptiles will find a safe spot to catch some rays and hang out there until they're ready to go about their day.</p>

					<p>After his weekly meal, usually a few large rats, or maybe a rabbit or two, Blanco would head for the nearest heat lamp in his enclosure to start the digestion process. However, without any melanin to protect his skin from the UV rays, he was effectively giving himself a sunburn every time he went to lay out.</p>

					<p>To help with the skin irritation caused by those burns, every other week we would have to remove him from his exhibit and scrub him down with a betadine solution. This generally wasn't a difficult process. Blanco was trained to follow the tapping of a tool we used every time we fed him. He would hear the "tap" and move to the location of the noise. Once out of his exhibit, we just had to cover his eyes, tape his mouth and lather him up with his zoo veterinarian approved lotion.</p>

					<p>Blanco was in a particularly cranky mood on a day we happened to be short-staffed and behind on time. The general rule of thumb when you have to get on an alligator or crocodile is one person for every three feet of animal. Blanco was around nine feet long, which meant we needed three people on hand to help restrain him for his bath. On this day though, we had to fudge the rules a bit.</p>

					<p>We returned Blanco to the opening of his exhibit where all we needed to do was remove his blindfold and untape his mouth and he would usually walk right on into his friendly confines. I hopped on Blanco's back by myself, stradling his midsection and grabbed ahold of his taped jaws. My boss removed the tape, then his blindfold. Instead of realizing he was home and walking towards his exhibit, Blanco decided he wanted to go in reverse. I gently placed my feet behind his legs, taking his feet out from underneath him. He responded by thrashing back and forth, slamming me into the glass wall of his exhibit and the door on the opposite side. This lasted for about five seconds, with me hanging on for dear life, trying not to let loose of his bone-crushing jaws. </p>

					<p>The bushmaster (Lachesis muta) is a large venomous pit viper species found in southern Central America and the northern half of South America including the island of Trinidad. They prefer remote, relatively cool, heavily forested moist tropical forests from low mountainous areas to coastal lowlands.</p>

					<p>The bushmaster is a very large snake, with specimens often exceeding 6,5 ft (2 m) in length. But they can grow to be over 12 ft (3.5 m) making them the longest venomous snake found in the Americas.</p>

					<p>Pit vipers get their name from the extremely sensitive organs found between the eyes and nostrils that function as infrared heat sensors, enabling them to detect the body heat of their prey. This allows them to see the world in the visible spectrum of light like humans but also in the infrared spectrum.</p>

					<p>The venom of a bushmaster has powerful haemotoxic properties and it affects the circulatory system, destroys the red blood cells, causes organ degeneration and massive tissue damage. If left untreated a bite will usually be fatal. Other effects include vomiting, severe pain, nausea, and chills. The few bite records available suggest an 80% mortality rate in humans, making the bushmaster the deadliest snake in the Americas.</p>

					<div id="SltgText">
					<p>Known to scientists as Uroplatus (meaning "flat tail") phantasticus (meaning "good lord what is this thing and why is it looking at me like that?"), the satanic leaf-tailed gecko is one of 14 species in its genus, including the mossy leaf-tailed gecko, which long ago renounced Satan in favor of Mosses. These geckos are found only in Madagascar, and emerge only at night to hunt.</p>

					<p>The satanic leaf-tailed gecko has its own predators aplenty, including birds and snakes and rats. If they decide to stand their ground, they stare down their foes, and suddenly widely open their mouths, emit loud cries, show the reddish tongue and mucosa and try to bite. They'll also flash their tails to confuse the potential predator, but should that fail, they can leap deftly from branch to branch or straight down to the leaf litter. But, really, it's best to just avoid being seen in the first place. And that, of course, is where their amazing camouflage really comes into play. Not only does the gecko's tail look like a dead leaf, so too does its body.</p>

					<p>Reinforcing this camouflage for the satanic leaf-tailed geckos is their behavior: They'll spend the day hanging motionless off of branches or snuggling among dead leaves, often twisting their leafy tails around their bodies. Other larger species in the satanic's genus have still another strategy for sleeping safely during the day, flattening their bodies against tree trunks and limbs, making good use of those famously grippy feet (a magic power derived, by the way, from countless hair-like structures that allow some geckos to even stick to inverted glass panes, not that nature would ever ask them to). Fringes and flaps along the edges of their bodies help erase their outlines and shadows, dissolving the geckos into the bark.</p>

					<p>Offspring are born with variations, just as you and your siblings look and behave differently. And these variations either end up suiting the organism better or worse to its environment. Critters with the magic variations-say, looking a bit like the leaves they live in-have a better chance of surviving (by being more likely to escape a predator's notice) to pass these genes along. Thus does a species adapt ever so slowly to its environment over evolutionary time. It's been happening on Earth for billions of years. The satanic leaf-tailed gecko just happens to be one of its more fantastically molded triumphs.</p>

					<p>They are also notioursly difficult to breed in captivity. With habitat destruction moving at an alarming pace in Madagascar, its imperative that zoos find success with their breeding programs for all animals from that beleaguered country. That little guy perched atop the pencil was one of my best success stories during my time as a zookeeper.</p>
