	<h1>Stories from the Herpetarium</h1>

		<h2>Blanco</h2>

			<p>Blanco was our resident American alligator at the Houston Zoo. He suffered from a condition called leucism. Unlike albinism, leucism is caused by a partial or complete loss of <em>all</em> types of pigment, not just melanin. Think of it as having one huge white spot, with the occasional blotch of normal pigmentation, and blue eyes instead of the pale, pink eyes associated with albinism.</p>
			
			<p>This all sounds pretty neat until you consider the physiology of an alligator, or all reptiles for that matter.</p>

			<p>Reptiles need heat to help them digest their food. Due to being cold-blooded, they dont have the ability to thermoregulate their body temperature like warm-blooded animals. In order to raise their body temperature, most reptiles will find a safe spot to catch some rays and hang out there until they're ready to go about their day.</p>

			<p>After his weekly meal, usually a few large rats, or maybe a rabbit or two, Blanco would head for the nearest heat lamp in his enclosure to start the digestion process. However, without any melanin to protect his skin from the UV rays, he was effectively giving himself a sunburn every time he went to lay out.</p>

			<p>To help with the skin irritation caused by those burns, every other week we would have to remove him from his exhibit and scrub him down with a betadine solution. This generally wasn't a difficult process. Blanco was trained to follow the tapping of a tool we used every time we fed him. He would hear the "tap" and move to the location of the noise. Once out of his exhibit, we just had to cover his eyes, tape his mouth and lather him up with his zoo veterinarian approved lotion.</p>

		<h2>Bushmaster</h2>

			<p>The bushmaster (Lachesis muta) is a large venomous pit viper species found in southern Central America and the northern half of South America including the island of Trinidad. â€‹They prefer remote, relatively cool, heavily forested moist tropical forests from low mountainous areas to coastal lowlands.</p>

			<p>The bushmaster is a very large snake, with specimens often exceeding 6,5 ft (2 m) in length. But they can grow to be over 12 ft (3.5 m) making them the longest venomous snake found in the Americas.</p>

			<p>Pit vipers get their name from the extremely sensitive organs found between the eyes and nostrils that function as infrared heat sensors, enabling them to detect the body heat of their prey. This allows them to see the world in the visible spectrum of light like humans but also in the infrared spectrum.</p>

			<p>The venom of a bushmaster has powerful haemotoxic properties and it affects the circulatory system, destroys the red blood cells, causes organ degeneration and massive tissue damage. If left untreated a bite will usually be fatal. Other effects include vomiting, severe pain, nausea, and chills. The few bite records available suggest an 80% mortality rate in humans, making the bushmaster the deadliest snake in the Americas.</p>
