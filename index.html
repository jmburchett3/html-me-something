		<h2>The One About Blanco</h2>

			<p>Blanco was our resident American Alligator at the Houston Zoo. He suffered from a condition called leucism. Unlike albinism, leucism is caused by a reduction in <em>all</em> types of pigment, not just melanin. Think of it as having one huge white spot, with the occasional blotch of normal pigmentation, and blue eyes instead of the pale, pink eyes associated with albinism.</p>
			
			<p>This all sounds pretty neat until you consider the physiology of an alligator, or all reptiles for that matter. </p>
